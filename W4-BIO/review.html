                <p>As a kid I watched the cartoon version of Transformers and it was very appealing to me. The main character Optimus Prime was one of my favorite character because of how humble he is. The voice that he has is just so soothing and make me. The feeling of listening to Peter Cullens make Optimus Primes voice come alive is exciting. The Movies were all so exciting to me because it's my childhood coming to life.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The Movies the Micheal Bay had Directed we really good im my honest opinion. He mad sure that the Majority of the Characters were the way they were suppose to be. This is why a lot of people are so attached to the movies that were created. The cinematographer in this was great including all the expoltions that he planted in the film. It gives that extra feeling the weapons they are using are coming to life. Over all the movies that were created Mainly the First was Overwhelmingly positive for someone who LOVES the Transformers Franchise.  </p>

                    <h3><em>Transformers</em> Movie Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bumblebee's alternate mode in the original Transformers film was a VolksWagon Bug however director Michael Bay feared comparison to Herbie the Lovebug. Therefore, Bumblebee takes the form of a Chevrolet Camero in the 2009 adaptation. As a tribute to the original, Bumblebee is positioned next to a Volkswagen Beetle in the car dealership scene.</li>
                        <li>In the film, the name "Autobot" stands for "Autonomous Robotic Organism."</li>
                        <li>Most of the cars that were destroyed in the film had their engines and transmissions removed to make them easier to flip around.</li>
